# Underground Artist Portfolio

## Structure

- `index.html` — Home, dynamic highlights, minimal hero, navigation, footer
- `projects.html` — Projects grid
- `coverart.html` — Cover art grid
- `about.html` — About you
- `contact.html` — Contact form and socials
- `images/` — All your images (cover art, projects, etc.)
- `styles/` — Tailwind CSS
- `scripts/` — JavaScript (e.g., works.js)

## How to Add Works
- Add your images to the `images/` folder.
- Edit `scripts/works.js` to add new works (see the sample structure in that file).
- Make sure each work has a unique `id` for direct linking.

## Running Locally
- Use a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server, Python's `http.server`, or similar) to view the site. Opening files directly may break JS imports.

## Deployment
- Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting provider.

## Customization
- Edit the HTML files to update your content, navigation, and layout.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
